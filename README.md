## Prerequisites

- A linux machine with **Docker** installed.
- Access to your code repository.
- A **Clerk** account.

## Setup

The setup process is divided into three main parts: **Jenkins**, **Clerk**, and the **Frontend**.

---

### 1. Jenkins Setup

1. **Clone this repository to your machine:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/skignes/Platypus-Checker.git
    cd Platypus-Checker
    ```

2. In the `docker-compose` file, change the environment variable named `FRONTEND_URL` to the URL of your frontend.

    ```docker-compose
    environment:
      FRONTEND_URL: "http://<your-url>/"
      CASC_JENKINS_CONFIG: "/var/jenkins_home/casc_configs"
      USER_ADMIN_PASSWORD: "admin"
      USER_API_PASSWORD: "api"
      BINARY: "/opt/jenkins/binary"
      JSON: "/opt/jenkins/json"
    ```

3. **Build the Jenkins instance:**

    ```bash
    docker compose build jenkins --no-cache
    ```

4. **Start Jenkins:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up jenkins -d
    ```

5. **Access Jenkins:**
   Open `http://<your-ip>:8080` in your browser.

    - Default credentials:
        - **User:** `admin`
        - **Password:** `admin`

---

### 2. Clerk Configuration

1. **Configure Clerk metadata:**

    - In your Clerk dashboard, go to **Configure** > **Session**.
    - Under customization for `sessions`, add:

    ```
    {
        "metadata": "{{user.public_metadata}}"
    }
    ```

    - It should look like this:

    ![Clerk General Configuration](img/clerk_general_config.jpg)

> [!NOTE]
> The next step is optional

2. If you want to deploy it on the **internet** follow the documentation of **Clerk** : https://clerk.com/docs/deployments/overview

3. **Set user permissions:**

    - When connecting via GitHub, users will not have access by default.
    - Assign permissions in the **metadata** section for each user:
        - `admin`: Access to all projects.
        - `ftrace`: Access to the `ftrace` project.
        - `zappy`: Access to the `zappy` project.
        - Multiple permissions can be assigned as a list.

    - Example for `admin` permission:

    ![Admin Clerk Permission](img/admin_clerk_permission.jpg)

    - Example for `ftrace` permission:

    ![Ftrace Clerk Permission](img/ftrace_clerk_permission.jpg)

    - Example for multiple permissions:

    ![Multiple Clerk Permission](img/multiple_clerk_permission.jpg)

---

### 3. Frontend Setup

1. **Create an environment file in the `frontend` directory:**

    - Connect as the `api` user (password: `api`) in Jenkins.
    - Create a new API Key at: `http://<your-ip>:8080/user/api/security/`
    - Go to the `frontend` directory and create/edit the `.env` file:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    nvim .env
    ```

    - Add the following variables:

    ```env
    JENKINS_URL=**********
    JENKINS_API_KEY=**********
    JENKINS_USER=**********
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=**********
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=**********
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCTION=********** # true or false
    ```

    - For more details on Clerk, see the wiki.

2. **Build the frontend:**

    ```bash
    docker compose build frontend --no-cache
    ```

3. **Start the frontend:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up frontend -d
    ```

    - The frontend will be available at: `http://<your-ip>:3000`

---

### 4. Pipeline Configuration

1. **Run the Seed job:**

    - In Jenkins, run the `Seed` job with the **user** and **repository name** (e.g., `skignes/Platypus-Checker`).
    - A new job will be created in the `PSU` directory.
    - To test a repository, build the job and wait for the results (ensure all dependencies are installed).
    - You can change the directory and other parametersâ€”see the wiki for more information.


## Usage

### SSH Key

To run the tests on your private repository you need to add a `ssh-key`. So to do so you need to run this command inside the docker :

```bash
# Go inside the docker
docker exec -it jenkins-platypus zsh
# Generate a new ssh key
ssh-keygen
```

Put the information you want.

When this is done you can now add this key to your **Github** account.

After you can now go into the [new credentials settings](http://localhost:8080/manage/credentials/store/system/domain/_/newCredentials) and add a new ssh key :

![Add SSH Key](img/ssh-key.jpg)

Now for each job in the settings of the build you can select the `credentials` to use for this repo and then you select your ssh-key.

You can build your private project now.

### Accept the script

I put a script protection to not execute everything i don't want on this jenkins.

So to be able to continue to the next step you need to accept the `seed` job script.

To do so you need to go into the [settings](http://localhost:8080/manage/scriptApproval/) and you will get a **Approve** and a **Deny**. I suggest you approve but this is up to you.

![Accept the Script](img/script.jpg)

### Run the job

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The job will only run on the branch named `main`

So to run the job you first need to **seed** it. To do so you need to go into the seed job at the root of the jenkins.
You can build it with the name you want for the new job (the one the check will be done on).
Then You can find this job in the `PSU` directory (because it is the default one) but this can be change.

When the job is build you will get a nice graph with the info if you :

- `passed`: The test was successfull
- `skipped`: The isn't even run cause the build failed
- `failed`: The test failed

![Test Result](img/test.jpg)

To see the **Github** repository there is a github button. You can click on it and it will redirect you to the repository.

On the **workspace** part there is the log of the tests runned. And also the repository when it was clone.

> [!CAUTION]
> The job will fail if the repo just got created.
